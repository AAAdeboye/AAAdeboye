# 👋 Hi, I'm Adedolapo

🎓 **Mechanical Engineering Student** — University of Ibadan  
🤖 Aspiring **Robotics Researcher** | 💻 Python & C++ Learner | ⚙️ Automation & Controls Enthusiast  

I’m building a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and programming to prepare for advanced research in **robotics** and **intelligent systems**. My studies focus on how **mechanical design**, **control systems**, and **computational methods** can merge to create adaptive and efficient machines.
